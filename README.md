# SMRPG-freebie-chart
dynamic endgame note set with custom logic depending on what freebies you get in a SMRPG speedrun, updated for peach chart 1.08. unfortunately the super jump numbers will only make sense to me and anyone else who counts in 4s, so download this and change it yourself if you want. freebie strats may not match what you're comfortable doing

the purple area can be used on your OBS layout, the buttons on screen update it as well as update the notes on the right
